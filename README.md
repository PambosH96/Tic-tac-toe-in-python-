Introduction To Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python  It is a two-player game. I have built a two-player tic-tac-toe game, which you can play in the command-line. Initially, I made an empty game board and then I will take  inputs from the players and I wiill check for the winning condition and if the whole board gets filled and no one wins, I will declare the result as “Tie” and ask users if they want to restart the game.In this game, there is a board with 3×3 squares. In this game a player can choose between two symbols with his opponent, the usual games use “X” and “O”. If the first player chooses “X”, then the second player must play with “O” and vice versa.
